# Sort array of objects

A simple html/javascript file which creates an array of objects (in this case animals). Then adds 2 more objects to the array. Then sorts 
the array by number of animal legs. Then sorts the array alphabetically by animal name. The information is displayed in alerts in the browser:

## Purpose

Mostly as a learning exercise for myself, as I'm currently learning JavaScript.
