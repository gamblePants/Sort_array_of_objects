# Sort array of objects

A simple html/javascript file which creates an array of objects (in this case animals). Then adds 2 more objects to the array. Then sorts 
the array by number of animal legs. Then sorts the array alphabetically by animal name. The information is displayed in alerts in the browser:

## Purpose

Mostly to help myself learn methods for sorting arrays in JavaScript.

## How to run program

<ul>
  <li>Easiest way is to run the program online on JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/gamblePants/1z7cfyk8/</li>
  <li>(You will have to click OK through all 3 alerts, before being able to view the code in full)</li>
  <li>Alternatively go to the "release" tab above, then rightclick on the exercise9.html file and select "Save As"</li>
  <li>Once you have downloaded the html file you can double-click on it to run in a browser, or open with a text editor to view the code</li>
